# Road_Accident_Analytics
## Introduction

Welcome to the project "Road Accident Analytics," where we explore and visualize India's road accident landscape in the year 2021. In this repository, we provide an insightful journey into the process of acquiring, cleaning, and visualizing the data to gain a comprehensive understanding of the road accident scenario.

## Data Source

The primary data source for this project is [data.gov.in](https://data.gov.in/), where we retrieved the relevant datasets related to road accidents in India for the year 2021.

## Steps to Process the Data

### 1. Importing Data from data.gov.in to Excel

We initiated the data processing pipeline by retrieving the raw data from data.gov.in and importing it into Microsoft Excel. This step involved downloading the datasets in a suitable format and utilizing Excel's data importing functionalities.

### 2. Removing Unwanted Columns

To streamline the dataset and focus on essential information, we performed a thorough analysis and identified columns that were not pertinent to our visualization goals. Subsequently, these unwanted columns were removed from the dataset.

### 3. Re-organized Table Structure

To enhance data accessibility and organization, we restructured the table by arranging columns in a logical and intuitive order. This step aimed to simplify the dataset and facilitate a more straightforward exploration of the information.

### 4. Changing Data Types

Ensuring data consistency and accuracy is crucial for effective visualization. We reviewed and adjusted data types to align with the nature of the information in each column. This step addressed any discrepancies and prepared the dataset for seamless integration into visualization tools.

### 5. Importing Data in Power BI and Building Visualizations

The final stage of our data processing journey involved importing the refined dataset into Microsoft Power BI. Leveraging the powerful visualization capabilities of Power BI, we created insightful charts, graphs, and dashboards to present a comprehensive picture of India's road accident landscape in 2021.


Feel free to explore, analyze, and contribute to our endeavor to uncover meaningful insights from the data.

Happy visualizing!
